# CAQL

## Overview

The CAQL Check allows users to create new metrics from combining or performing analytics on other metrics.

## Metrics

Within Circonus, each CAQL metric is its own check which provides exactly one metric. The name of that metric is chosen by the creator of the check.

## Notes

For full details, please see the [CAQL Documentation](/caql)
