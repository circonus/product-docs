Circonus creates [metric](/circonus3/additional-resources/glossary#metric) metadata known as [stream tags](/circonus3/additional-resources/glossary#stream-tag) to provide all the capabilities of the Metrics 2.0 specification; self-describing, and orthogonal tags for every decision. In addition, stream tags offer extra capabilities as detailed below.

In addition to stream tags, every integration you add will automatically create integration-specific tags that display integration-level metadata. You also have the ability to add custom tags to each integration -- both from the Circonus account and from the configuration file that CUA uses.

Learn more about Circonus' use of [stream tags](https://www.circonus.com/2018/11/introducing-circonus-stream-tags/).
