# Registration Tokens

## Overview

Circonus’s Agent Manager requires a registration token to communicate with Circonus so your configuration files can be managed from the UI.

To get started with the Passport platform, you’ll need to create a registration token and add it to the Agent Manager during installation.

## Create a registration token

1. Navigate to the **Passport > Registration Tokens** list view page.
2. Click on **Create token**.
3. Specify an expiration date and click **Save**.

All successfully created registration tokens will populate the list view page seen below.
