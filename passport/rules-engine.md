All created rules will be listed in the Rules tab and if more than 1 rule has been created, they can be ordered to specify which rule has the most importance.

## Manage Rules

Many **Actions** are available to take for the rules such as **Edit, **Clone, **Copying** to other** **configurations** or **Deleting** the rule.
