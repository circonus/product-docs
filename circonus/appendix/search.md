# Searching

## Metric Search

Metric search uses the native IRONdb time-series database search syntax. This move
empowers the Circonus UI to make use of all of IRONdb's powerful tagging support.

If you are supplying stream tags on the metrics you submit, you can search on
them using an expression that matches one or more tags. Expressions may be a
literal `category:value` for exact matches, a regular expression, or a glob
(wildcard) match string. You can use different types of expressions for the
category versus the value, as well (see below).

### Pattern Expressions

Patterns can be used in the category or the value, or both.

#### Regular Expression Patterns

Regular expressions follow the Perl-Compatible Regular Expression, v2 (PCRE2)
[syntax](https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html), and are enclosed in `/ /`:

- `/category regex/:/value regex/`

#### Glob Patterns

Glob patterns use `*` as a wildcard, and can be used as prefix or suffix
completers or to identify a substring match:

- `categ*:value`
- `category:val*`
- `*egory:*alu*`

### Logical Operators

Matching tags may be added to or excluded from the result set based on the
Boolean operators `and`, `or`, and `not`.

Both `and` and `or` accommodate a single expression as well as a
comma-separated list of expressions:

| Query                   | Description                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `and(foo:bar)`          | exactly `foo:bar`               |
| `and(foo:bar,baz:quux)` | all of `foo:bar` and `baz:quux` |
| `or(foo:bar,baz:quux)`  | any of `foo:bar` or `baz:quux`  |

The `not` operator may only contain a single expression:

- `not(other:thing)`

Operators can also be grouped for more complex queries:

- `and(and(*:thing),not(other:thing))` : All `thing`s except `other:thing`

### Built-In Tags

There is a set of synthetic, "built-in" tag categories that appear for _all_
metrics, regardless of whether they were submitted with any other tags:

| Category            | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__activity`        | Range of time for which metrics are desired              |
| `__check_broker`    | Name of the broker on which the check runs               |
| `__check_bundle_id` | ID of the check_bundle                                   |
| `__check_id`        | ID of the check                                          |
| `__check_module`    | Name of the broker module that implements the check type |
| `__check_name`      | Name of the check                                        |
| `__check_target`    | Target of the check                                      |
| `__check_uuid`      | UUID of the check                                        |
| `__name`            | Metric name                                              |

### Tag Search Examples

## Object Search

Object search takes place in our Postgres database and makes use of the pg_trgm module and the concept of similarity. When you search for an item like "foo", Circonus sends that term to the DB and asks for items with a similar name. You can still use wildcards; for example, if you search for "foo\*", Circonus instead sends a like query for anything starting with foo.

This similarity means that if we have an item with the title "Foobar" and we search for "foo", our title is similar enough to match. However, if our title is "Foobar server statistics", searching for just "foo" is not similar enough due to the extra bits that don't match, so here we would want to search for "foo\*". Details on how this similarity works are at the end of this section.

### Basic Search Examples

Search for names _similar_ to the word "foo":

    foo

Search for the exact name "foo"

    "foo"

Search for names beginning with "foo":

    foo*

Search for names that contain "foo" either at the start, end, or in the middle:

    *foo*

Search for names similar to "foo bar":

    foo bar

Search for a specific IP or hostname:

    "192.168.1.1"
    "www.circonus.com"

Search for names that contain "foo" followed by "bar" but with possible other items in between:

    "*foo*bar*"

### Narrowing Search Using Specific Terms

There will be times where you want to narrow your search by providing additional details, like a check type, or a broker name, etc. To accomplish this, each item has a list of fields that you can specify in parenthesis to refine searches. Some examples of this would include:

Search for a check with the name like foo on the Ashburn broker:

    foo (broker:Ashburn*)

If needed, you can narrow by multiple items separated by a comma:

    foo (tags:os:linux,datacenter:ashburn)

If the term you want to search on has a comma in it, to prevent the system from treating that as a list wrap the term in quotes:

    foo (name:"name, with comma")

### Default Search Field and Available Terms

| description | string | Description of worksheet         |               |
| notes       | string | Notes on worksheet               |               |
| tags        | string | Tags associated with this object |               |

### Filtering Search Results with Tags

Circonus also allows you to use tags to filter your search results in the same way you would refine the search using a specific term as above.

For example, to search for items with the word "foo" that are tagged with "application:bar", you would enter the following search terms:

    foo (tags:application:bar)

To filter your search results using multiple tags, separate the tags with commas (,). For example:

    foo (tags:application:bar,os:omnios)

### How Similarity Works

As stated above, the default analysis for a search result is how similar it is to a search term on the primary field. This boils down to how many of the trigrams (groups of 3 characters) made from this term match the trigrams of the term we are matching.

For example, let's assume we are using the search term "foo", and searching for 2 checks, one simply called "foobar", and the other called "foobar host stats". Note that Circonus search is case insensitive, so examples will be in lower case.

First, this is what the trigrams for the terms look like:

```
circonus=> select show_trgm('foo');
        show_trgm
-------------------------
 {"  f"," fo",foo,"oo "}
```

```
circonus=> select show_trgm('foobar');
              show_trgm
-------------------------------------
 {"  f"," fo","ar ",bar,foo,oba,oob}
```

```
circonus=> select show_trgm('foobar host stats');
                                          show_trgm
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"  f","  h","  s"," fo"," ho"," st","ar ",ats,bar,foo,hos,oba,oob,ost,"st ",sta,tat,"ts "}
```

Now that we've broken down our terms, we need to compare their trigrams. In order for us to say a term is similar enough to return it in a search, the two trigrams have to have a 30% similarity.

So matching foo on itself we can see that it is a 100% match:

```
circonus=> select similarity('foo', 'foo');
 similarity
------------
          1
```

And if we look at foo compared to foobar, we see they are similar enough to match:

```
circonus=> select similarity('foo', 'foobar');
 similarity
------------
      0.375
```

However, when we look at foo vs foobar host stats, we cross the edge of similarity due to the extra characters in the name:

```
circonus=> select similarity('foo', 'foobar host stats');
 similarity
------------
   0.157895
```

So while you might expect foobar host stats to match because it starts with foo, it didn't because it wasn't similar enough. In this case you have two options, first would be to simply add a to your search to pull everything starting with foo, or if you still wanted to only get items that are similar, just add more of the string you want.

```
circonus=> select similarity('foobar', 'foobar host stats');
 similarity
------------
   0.388889
```

or

```
circonus=> select similarity('foobar host', 'foobar host stats');
 similarity
------------
   0.666667
```

## Advanced Search Builder

The advanced search builder tool exists to help with learning how the new Search (v2) works. On supported pages, after expanding the search field you will see an "advanced" button to the right of the search field. Clicking this will expand the advanced search builder which will help you learn how to construct advanced search queries.
![Image: 'Advanced_Search_Builder2.png'](../img/Advanced_Search_Builder2.png)

Within the primary field, you may use quotation marks for exact matching ("foo"), wildcard asterisks for substring matching (foo*, *foo, or *foo*bar\*), or plain text for trigram matching.

Within the non-primary fields, only exact matching and substring matching is supported. Note that your non-primary field entries will be automatically wrapped in quotation marks if you don't use wildcards.
