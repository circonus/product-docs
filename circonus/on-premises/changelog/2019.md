# Release Notes 2019

## Operator Note

Circonus has transitioned check tags (those that are associated with an entire
check, rather than stream tags, which are associated with a single metric) from
being stored in the PostgreSQL database to being stored in IRONdb.

Operators are advised to run the following script from the system that serves
the "hub" role in your deployment:

```
/www/bin/checks/migrate_tags_to_snowth.pl
```

This will sync all existing check tags from PostgreSQL to IRONdb.
Depending on the number of checks and tags, this may take a while to run, so
using a terminal multiplexer such as tmux or screen is recommended.  It should
only be necessary to run this script once after updating to the 2019-05-06
release or later, but it will not hurt anything to run it more than once.

**As of the 2019-07-01 release, GoAPI no longer uses the PostgreSQL database
for metric searches, so it is necessary to run this script before updating to
the current release, if you have not already.**

* Bug: An error in the logic used when looking up a single metric by CID, using
  the `/metric/{cid}` endpoint, sometimes produced an incorrect result. This
  occurred when the metric shared the same name as other metrics and contained
  stream tags which were a subset of other metrics' stream tags.
* Bug: An error in JSON decoding for `alert_format` values by the contact group
  service resulted in a failure to update contact group when `alert_format`
  field values contained the JSON `null` value.

### Reconnoiter

Version: 0.1.1571258240 (9e5e96f)

* Broker: redo statsd module to use histograms intelligently.
  * This is a breaking change as metric names will change.  However, the prior
    implementation was severely broken and not cluster-capable.  This should
    use histograms where it makes sense.  For counters, we count in the zero
    bucket so that no one attempts to sum them (they should count them).
* Add support for cumulative histogram metrics, such as those exposed by
  libmtev jobq stats.
* Broker: be more lenient with DNS timeout handling

### Web UI/API

### data_storage

Version: 0.1.1570133025 (aed1386)

* Performance improvements related to opening raw timeshards.
* Various performance improvements related to data fetching:
  * Less piecemeal work is performed, which means that long runs of fetches are
    performed in the same jobq and not fanned out as extensively.
  * Epoch/apocalypse times for numeric fetches are accelerated using activity
    tracking.
  * The /rollup `engine=dispatch` endpoint now does a simple merge of nntbs and
    raw.
  * Legacy /rollup behaviour of a complex nntbs/raw/nntbs sandwich is available
    via `engine=dispatch_coarsen`.
* Greatly improve performance when fetching rollup data for a stream that has
  no historic data before the starting time and for which there are many prior
  raw timeshards. This improves the fetch time from tens of seconds to tens of
  milliseconds.
* Bug: Fix memory leaks in raw data iterator and surrogate db loading.
* Bug: Change the `/fetch` API endpoint to perform work in the
  `snowth_fetch_remote` and `snowth_fetch_local` jobqs. It was using an
  incorrect jobq before.
* Bug: Fix use-after-free that could cause crashes when using the `/fetch` API
  endpoint.
* Bug: Fix `ck_fifo` usage to prevent memory misuse that could lead to crashes
  when loading the surrogate DB or processing journal replication data.
* Bug: Fix various potential crashes in reconstitute/rebalance.
* Bug: Fix console web UI to prevent abusive loading of json data after a
  suspended connection is reestablished.
* Change raw data reconstitute to use flatbuffers instead of M records. **This
  is a breaking change for reconstitute. Once a node is upgraded to this
  version or later, all other nodes must be upgraded before reconstitute will
  work properly again.**
* Add `surrogate_database/@{latest_future_bound,implicit_latest}` and track the
  latest arriving value for metrics accordingly. Expose them via find according
  to a `latest` query string parameter.
* Performance improvements in database iteration - should improve both insert
  and fetch operations.
* Bug: Ensure that surrogate db reconstitute is finished before inserting text
  and histogram records during reconstitute to avoid potential race conndition
  when updating the surrogate db.
* CAQL: Support for labeling multiple output streams with `label()` function.

### libmtev

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 1.8.4

* Fix alignment issue in logging related to freeing built flatbuffers. This
  requires a patched flatcc 0.4.3, or 0.5.0 or later. configure.in was updated
  to enforce this requirement. The bug manifested as a crash on large log
  messages (10s of kilobytes or more).
* Fix MPMC `ck_fifo` in `mtev_log` to be 16-byte aligned (crash bug).
* File-based (and stderr) logs now split newlines into separate annotated log
  statements making logs easier to read.
* Address several crash issues with ACO+eventer interaction
* The stock web UI javascript was fixed to prevent a flurry of queued API
  requests when the application comes back up after an interruption and the UI
  remained active in the browser.
* Elide a function call in the logging path when zipkin spans aren't active.
* Update the web support to assist displaying clusters.

* Feature: Metric search requests will now include a header in the response,
  called `X-Snowth-Search-Result-Count`. This value is the estimated total
  number of results reported by IRONdb that match the find query executed. This
  value may be different than the actual number of metric results returned by
  the request due to response limits and the pagination settings used in the

* Support logging thread names that are set via `mtev_thread_*` APIs.
* Fix issue where the watchdog failed to restart broken child processes under
  certain OOM conditions on Linux.
* Change default behaviour of jobqs to be GC (garbage-collected) not CS
  (critical-section) for SMR (safe memory reclamation). This provides better
  performance with fewer locks.
* Cleanup some ABI exposure in the lua modules.
* Fix pathological performance issues with large HTTP responses that were

  This reduces reading from a hostile endpoint sending small chunks
  (10-20bytes) for a 1Mb payload from 25s down to 0.5s.

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1567705501 (5060360)

* API bugfix: IRONdb check tag metadata was not being updated correctly when
  checks were created or modified using the `/check_bundle` API endpoint. This
  only affected checks modified via API calls, not checks created or modified
  using the UI. The [check tag migration script](#operator-note) (see above)
  should be run again after updating to this release, to ensure all IRONdb
  check tag metadata is correct.

* Bug: De-duplicate histograms. Fixes a bug where several different H1 messages
  received for the same histogram metric would be aggregated. We only want to
  do that if the timestamps are different.
* Improvements to debugging facilities:
  * Add audit system that allows one to selectively emit debugging information
    for a set of checks
  * Improve xcall/statement information
* Bug: If two CAQL `find()` queries were matching the same metric, only one of
  them would get data.

    applied. This change makes it such that jitter is not applied when logging
    a histogram with an explicit `_ts` setting.
* Feature: (broker) Support the `_ts` field on HTTPtrap payloads in synch mode,
  as if it were set to asynch (measurements are recorded as they are received.)
* Bug: (broker) Fix HTTPtrap payloads with duplicate data dropping some data.
* Bug: (broker) Fix how modules are determining complete HTTP payloads. It's
  not how much you've received, it is how much we've read from the wire.  If we
  can't decompress something we could get stuck thinking there should be more
  data when the http client has already ready everything.

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1566577260 (b6fb543)

* UI Design: Design update for site masthead and navigation menus.
* Bugfix: Fixed CAQL, Cluster & Search Graph datapoints which can return
  different sets of metrics when the graph is refreshed, so that the legend
  remains correct even when the set of metrics changes upon a graph refresh.
* API: The endpoints `/account` and `/metric_cluster` are now being handled by
  GoAPI.
* Dashboard Text widgets have been improved, so they properly display the value
  range for histogram metric values.

### web_stream

Version: 0.1.1566399690 (40b7685)

* Bug: Add stream tag support to fix certain dashboard widgets that were not
  displaying properly for metrics that had stream tags.

### caql_broker

Version: 0.1.1565206165 (00ca7b9)

* Disable tag-search cache (since it does not work with check-tags). This will
  somewhat increase CPU utilization, and decrease memory usage.
* Enable check-tag replication modules. This will allow CAQL-broker to retrieve
  check-tag information from a snowth cluster. The snowth cluster information
  for check-tag replication will be pushed to the caql-broker via REST from
  a cron job on the hub role.
* Restrict web management UI access to localhost. This is the same behavior as
  on Enterprise Brokers. Operators who wish to have remote access should tunnel
  the connection over SSH.

Version: 0.1.1565218550 (9d97498)

> The functionality to perform a Postgres-based, check UUID oriented search in
> metric search has been removed. This has been fully replaced by the more
> efficient and accurate search based on IRONdb tag search functionality. In
> previous releases, the new search functionality needed to be enabled with an

> setting is no longer needed or used.
>
> See the Operator Note at the top of this page for details on migrating check
> tags from Postgres to IRONdb. This is now required to be run in order for
> metric search results to work properly.

* Bug: An incorrect error code was being returned when the metric search
  service received a parse error response from IRONdb.
* Bug: The format of the `_cid` field returned by metric search API requests
  did not include metric name stream tags and therefore was not guaranteed to
  be unique for any given metric.
* Bug: The `X-Circonus-More-Items` header was not being returned correctly for
  some API metric search requests.
* Updates authentication service caching to improve performance and
  compatibility with Perl services.
* Updates cache utilization and adds database package improvements to the
  user service to improve overall GoAPI performance.
* Bug: Errors during parsing of invalid check definition XML were not being
  handled correctly in some cases, resulting in request failures.
* Bug: Database transaction close operations were causing a goroutine to hang
  indefinitely in some cases.

Version: 0.1.1565279419 (3ae47ca) (EL7, OmniOS)

Version: 0.1.1565279419 (c3e2040) (EL6)

* New hub cron job to sync check-tag information to caql_broker from IRONdb. 
* Raise fq client backlog to 100k messages in caql_broker configuration. This
  more reasonable limit will prevent unnecessary message drops.
* Update messaging for SSL/TLS certificate fetching 404 errors. It will more
  clearly indicate that another Hooper run may solve the problem.

### libmtev

Version: 0.1.1564162107 (fcd1316) (EL6)

* Fix permission issue with stratcon REST API and the `noit_version_check.js`
  script. A missing ACL rule caused the script to be unable to pull broker
  capability information.
* Add a module-load configuration to stratcon, a new dependency of the existing

* (broker, caql_broker) Increase timeout for cluster configuration pulling.

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1564083169 (5cc55db)

* UI: Ruleset creation UI now disables non-working features (buttons and fields
  that will not function until the ruleset is saved), then refreshes after the
  first save.
* UI: Enable display of deleted rulesets (such as when linked from an alert
  view).

* Metric search API calls may see improved performance as the service is now
  using activity metadata returned from IRONdb to determine metric active
  status. This reduces the complexity of the metric search operation and the
  number of queries sent to IRONdb.

  using SysV/init.d scripts for service management.
* Bug: The metric service was not properly handling v2 format queries in metric
  bundles.
* Bug: SysV init scripts failed to record the PID of the started service,
  breaking subsequent operations.
* GoAPI will now verify that any IRONdb nodes being accessed by internally used
  clients meet the minimum version requirements for the version of GoAPI
  running. Nodes running older versions will not be used by GoAPI internally,
  and error messages will be logged recording the occurrence. The node, its

  removed role or other permissions were failing to authenticate on `/account`
  endpoints.
* Bug: The `_active` field for the `/check` endpoint could contain inaccurate
  data.
* Improved thread safety, eliminating some unlikely, but possible, race
  conditions.
* Bug: The parser for v3 metric search queries contained a problem that could
  result in certain searches, containing unclosed quotation marks, triggering a
  process crash.
* Bug: Metric search v3 query processing was not correctly handling colon
  characters in tag values.

Version: 0.1.1560781040 (4c961bb) (EL7, OmniOS)

Version: 0.1.1560781040 (5bfd2ea) (EL6)

* Remove obsolete data import cron job from web_frontend hosts. This was an old
  feature for bringing historical, external data into Snowth. This can now be
  done by sending data to a broker and specifying the timestamp.
* Updated caql_broker configuration template, allows for including all API
  hosts in caql_broker configuration, not just the first one.
* circonus-ssl-term service is now native systemd (EL7 only)

### libmtev

  (suppressed from collection), in addition to the number collected ("stats").

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1560553557 (f17fcea)

* API: The `/check` and `/metric_cluster` endpoints are converted from the Perl
  service to GoAPI services.
* UI Bug: Grid Graphs' legends in narrow viewports (under 1200px) can be
  unreadably narrow, so they're now allowed to be wider, up to the full grid's
  width.
* UI Bug: The HTTP check config was missing the 'uri' field so when
  creating/editing a check, any entered target URL was reduced to only the host
  (the path was stripped off).
* UI Bug: When creating a graph from the Metrics Explorer, use the metrics'
  display names (without stream tags) when possible.
* When creating an HTTPtrap check in the UI, the new check will now default to
  non-asynchronous data collection, because this is more logical for most
  people.
* Updated the design of informational grids across the detail pages.
* UI Bug: Fixed the check module page's 'Existing' tab, where deleting a check
  would cause other checks to erroneously disappear.
* UI Bug: Fixed the 'Authorize PagerDuty' button on not-yet-authorized
  PagerDuty Contact Groups.
* UI Bug: Fixed user count shown on system dashboard, so it doesn't include the
  automatic account user.
* UI: Improved Dashboard list page: added sorting arrows to the table column
  header links, and made Title the default sort field.
* UI Bug: Fixed prompt modals' datepickers so they aren't clipped by the modal
  body.
* UI: Fixed Metrics Explorer bug: selecting a metric for graph creation, then
  paging to the next or previous page of metrics would forget the selected
  metrics from non-visible pages.
* Bug: Fixed error with missing lib "Circonus::DB" in check tag migration
  script.
* Updated Metric Details page so it now shows its Check UUID and canonical
  Metric name, and also indicates that the tags shown at the bottom of the page
  are not editable and are actually coming from its Check Bundle.

* Faster setmeta serialization for merge.
* Change histogram quantile/sum/mean operations to return approximations that
  minimize the relative error.
* Bug/CAQL: Fix `histogam:count_below()` to also count samples in the current
  bucket, as the documentation states.
* Bug/CAQL: `histogram:stddev()` will return nan for histograms with a single
  value not 0.

### fault_detection

Version: 0.1.1558637582 (4cf3ea8) (EL6)

* Use the appropriate service manager for circonus-fq on EL7, now that it is
  native systemd.
* Fix ruby compile error in fault_detection role if the [new site.json attributes](/circonus/on-premises/changelog/2019/#fault_detection-17)
  are left out.
* If crash reporting is enabled, it should be set up for the fault_detection
  role (faultd).

### libmtev

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 1.6.12

* Fix crash bug when an SSL/TLS listener has npn set to "none" explicitly and a
  client tried to upgrade via ALPN.
* SECURITY: bug fix in http authentication handling where thread fan out could
  short-circuit ACLs with allow.

### Reconnoiter

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 0.1.1559059743 (8b4bec9)

* Broker: Make httptrap immediate (async) mode more efficient.
* Broker: Improve httptrap and prometheus measurement batching.
* Broker: Add REST endpoint to redirect to the owning node in a cluster.
* Broker: fix crash bug where a bad metric name can produce a null metric
  record.
* Broker: Add `java.lang.Object` to the whitelist of types that JMX checks will
  collect.
* Stratcon: add a REST endpoint for showing the config.
* Broker: enable new OpenTSDB ingestion module.

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1559324336 (a95bc39)

* Ruleset API cid is now numeric, fixes API Object display for Dynamic Alerting
  rulesets.
* Preliminary Ruleset Tag Filter support for Dynamic Alerting (alpha).
* Bug: fixed the case where creating a maintenance window with a null start
  time (starting 'now') would throw an error.
* Allow the creation of maintenance windows in the past, to retroactively
  affect uptime reports.
* Added a new check type: Kubernetes (via the Prometheus module).
* When creating or editing a check, allow users to proceed even if DNS lookup
  of the target fails.

## 2019-05-20

### caql_broker

Version: 0.1.1558034337 (cfc7f5a)

* Raise read-limit for HTTP requests from 1Mb to 20Mb, allowing for larger
  histogram fetches from snowth/IRONdb.

### data_storage

Version: 0.1.1557957963 (2a19201)

* Move surrogate activity updates into its own column family. This
  significantly reduces the I/O required for most surrogate db updates.
  Previously when activity records were updated, the entire surrogate entry was
  rewritten. Now, if the only change is updating activity, a much smaller
  update will be done. **This change modifies the surrogate database structure,
  breaking backward compatibility. A node that has been updated cannot be
  downgraded.**
* Reduce likelihood of timeout when fetching recent numeric rollup data via
  Lua.
* `/rollup/` API and CAQL fetching functions now correctly defer reads on
  replication delay.
* Performance improvements when debugging is disabled.
* Add surrogate checkpoint latency stats.
* Delete metric search metadata flush can be disabled by
  `x-snowth-metadata-flush` header.

### fault_detection

See the [2019-05-06 release
notes](/circonus/on-premises/changelog/2019#2019-05-06) for important
configuration updates required if updating from a release prior to 2019-05-06.

Version (faultd): 0.1.1557855801 (9fc051c)

* Add support for tag filtering on `__name` and `__check_uuid` tags.
* Crash reporting will include the site domain for better identification by
  Circonus Support. This brings faultd crash reporting up to parity with
  reporting for other components.

Version (ernie): 0.1.1544639627 (db11a23)

* No changes since [2018-12-31](/circonus/on-premises/changelog/2018#2018-12-31)

### GoAPI

Related roles: api, web_frontend

Version: 0.1.1558239122 (c0284db)

* Improved connection error handling for both PostgreSQL and IRONdb database
  connections.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1558015453 (a26f55d)

* Configure circonus.conf key `Snowth::timeout` to avoid CAQL graph errors due
  to negative timeout value.

### Reconnoiter

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 0.1.1558037805 (a297fa8)

* Improved error logging in the httptrap check module.

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1558117472 (88bb20a)

* UI: Removed check tag filters and filter sets from the UI. These features
  were incompatible with stream tags.
* UI: Improved graph histogram data processing times by 30-60% (not including data
  transfer times).
* UI Bug: Added a default `Snowth::timeout` value to prevent graph CAQL errors if
  the configuration key isn't set.
* Bug: When creating or editing a check on a broker whose ID doesn't match its
  group ID, a spurious error was thrown, saying the broker was invalid.
* Bug: Changing the alias of a broker group would take an excessive amount of
  time, during which check creation would not work for that broker. This is now
  substantially quicker.

## 2019-05-06

### data_storage

Version: 0.1.1556907805 (28039c7)

* `/rollup/` and CAQL fetching functions now correctly defer reads on
  replication delay.
* Performance improvements in the `raw_ingestor` module used by Stratcon to
  send metrics into Snowth.
* Performance improvements in CAQL when debugging is disabled.
* Exposure of metric metadata into lua for use by CAQL and other lua extensions.
* Performance improvements when looking up locations on the topology ring.
* Ensure all journal replication threads are supplied with work. Previously, if
  more than one replication thread existed and there was not sufficient load to
  utilize all of them, some journal segments were not removed after their data
  was replicated. This led to increased disk usage over time, and was
  exacerbated by a change to the default journal replication concurrency in the
  2019-04-08 release.
* CAQL: Add type checking facilities to CAQL function arguments.
* CAQL: `histogram:count_*()` processing on higher periods, was off by a factor
  of `VIEW_PERIOD/60`. This is corrected now.
* CAQL: Expand label() functionality.
* CAQL: Add tag() function.
* Fix thread safety issues that could lead to occasional crashes.
* CAQL: Fix `find:histogram_cum()` functionality.
* CAQL: Performance Improvements.
* Additional IRONdb documentation on the [UI Internals tab](/irondb/administration/operations/#internals-tab),
  which contains a rich set of statistics for troubleshooting performance
  problems.

### fault_detection

This release brings a replacement for the fault-detection function of Ernie. A
new, libmtev-based application, "faultd", will now perform this function. The
previous Ernie service will remain but only performing its secondary role as
the "composite broker". It will no longer process rulesets or generate alerts.

In order to complete the transition, the following attributes must be added to
the `fault_detection` stanza in `site.json` prior to updating to this release:

```
"registration_token": "<uuid>"
```

where `<uuid>` is generated from the `uuidgen` command-line tool or other
source. This token will be pre-authorized to access the API in order to load
rulesets.

```
"faultd_cluster": {
    "server1": { "node_id": "<uuid>" },
    "server2": { "node_id": "<uuid>" }
}
```

where `<uuid>` is generated from the `uuidgen` command-line tool or other
source. This object describes the nodes that participate in the faultd
cluster. Each hostname from `_machlist` should be represented, each with their
own UUID.

Version (faultd): 0.1.1556628952 (926d69a)

* New package: `circonus-platform-fault-detection` (CentOS), `pkg://circonus/platform/fault-detection` (OmniOS)

Version (ernie): 0.1.1544639627 (db11a23)

* No changes since [2018-12-31](/circonus/on-premises/changelog/2018#2018-12-31)

### GoAPI

Version: 0.1.1556813464 (c49eb69)

* Metric lookup by CID fixed to work with stream tags.
* Performance improvements to metric searches by check_uuid that use wildcards
  in the metric name search term.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1557153261

* Configure new `faultd` daemon to replace Ernie's fault detection
  functionality. See the "fault_detection" section above.
* Add a configurable session key string to `circonus.conf`. This improves the
  security of session cookies when using Circonus native authentication.
  Operators may set the `session_key` attribute within the `web_frontend`
  section in `site.json` to an ASCII string of 8 or more characters. If not
  set, a default string will be generated. This setting has no effect for users
  that authenticate via LDAP or OAuth2/SAML.
  * **For deployments using Circonus native username/password authentication,**
    **all logged-in users will need to log in again after this update is**
    **applied.**
* As part of Template feature removal (see the Web UI section below), disable
  the following template-related services on the `hub` role:
  * `template_rules_sync`
  * `pending_check_processor`

### libmtev

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 1.6.10

* `mtev_intern` pools (reference-counted dictionaries of strings) with
  `extent_size` 0 should just malloc/free. This saves the work of doing
  compaction (including locking) on empty pools.
* Introduce `mtev_log_has_material_output` function to test whether a given log
  stream will result in actual output. Used to reduce the overhead of logging
  when a log stream is disabled (such as debug logs).
* Change the default jobq memory safety from `cs` to `gc`.

### Reconnoiter

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 0.1.1556127102 (7de1e31)

* Apply filtersets to histogram metrics.

### web_stream

Version: 0.1.1556920684 (e0a3880)

* Fix memory leak in message parsing.
* Make FQ subscription unconditional. Previously, some watch events did not
  connect to FQ.

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1556917562 (0e85542)

* UI: Fixed metric active status display on the check details page, so that
  when metrics are disabled manually, their status will be updated in the list
  sooner, usually within five minutes. Added notices to this effect to the
  check editing tab and the editing confirmation modal.
* UI: Fixed the metric details page which uses the standard metric search to
  pull some metric metadata; use a 10 year activity period instead of the
  default 2 weeks.
* UI: Updated how graph errors are shown so they can be shown on all types of
  graphs including histogram summary graphs.
* UI: Added an "unsupported" error when trying to view a histogram summary of a
  graph containing an aggregated cluster datapoint.
* UI: When warnings are returned from a graph CAQL datapoint in the new DF4
  format, return the warnings to the user and render them in the graph errors.
* UI: Templates have been permanently removed. All checks bound to templates
  have been unbound and are now standard editable checks.
* UI: Clarified notices around inactive checks so their relationship to their
  bundle is clearer.
* UI: Fixed the graph CAQL datapoint editor so error notices are removed when
  the error goes away.
* UI: Improved graph data request handling so that multiple data requests aren't
  firing over top of each other.
* UI: Fixed graph CAQL histogram detection so histogram data will be detected
  even if the first series is all nulls.
* UI: Bugfix to avoid a crash in shared dashboards.

## 2019-04-22

### data_storage

Version: 0.1.1555705775 (cf8a088)

* CAQL: Forward labels in top(k) queries
* CAQL: Fix cumulative histogram function.
* CAQL: Speed up `find()` and `histogram:create()`.
* CAQL: Fix rollup logic in `histogram:create()`. Previously, queries could
  return inconsistent results at higher rollup periods.
* Fixes for metric names longer than 1024 bytes.
* Set lower `snowth.get` timeout in Lua, to allow for query retries.
* Fix reconstitute bug in cases of incomplete file reads.
* Performance improvements to inter-node gossip communications.
* Support FlatBuffers requests in /histogram read endpoint.
* Support backlog display and stats filtering in UI (ported from libmtev).
* CAQL: Increase the default histogram fetch limit to 3M.
* CAQL: Accelerate sum/sub/prod/div operations.
* CAQL: histogram:percentile and histogram:count_* operations now act on
  multiple input slots rather than just the first one.

### GoAPI

Related roles: api, web_frontend

Version: 0.1.1555686909 (f4930dd)

* Fix issue with pipe (`|`) characters in metric names.
* Fix issues causing some database errors to fail to return properly, causing
  a request timeout.
* Fix issues with certain special characters in metric search queries and
  glob searches that were causing search failures.
* Fix routing for metric lookup by ID endpoints when used in conjunction with
  certain environments' load balancers.
* Update metric search query parsing to allow spaces in the primary search
  term (for metric name), before the first search term operator (and, or, not),
  even if it is not enclosed in quotes. Ex: `this used to be invalid and(now:it
  is not)`.
* Allow the process started with `goapi serve` to listen for REST API requests
  on ports for both UI search support and API metric search.  This eliminates
  the need to start two processes on API servers.
* Introduce support for a new metric CID format based on check UUID instead
  of check ID.  Metric endpoints will still return the current CID format in
  their data responses, but can lookup and respond to CIDs in both new and old
  formats.  The new format is `/metric/<check_UUID>_<metric_name>`, the
  existing format is `/metric/<check_ID>_<metric_name>`. No changes are
  required to any existing API tooling. A switch to the new format is planned
  for the future, but no date has been set at this time.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1555624984 (a3987ef) (EL7, OmniOS)

Version: 0.1.1555606399 (ee0f220) (EL6)

* Remove api-search service from API role. This functionality is now handled by
  the main GoAPI service.
* (OmniOS only): Always restart `svc://circonus/api` (GoAPI) each run, as the
  package gets updated prior to the API recipe, invalidating the
  restart-on-update trigger. All GoAPI operations are stateless and
  transactional, so this is not a disruptive change.
* (EL7 only): New Inside deployments will use the "NNTBS" backing store format
  for snowth.

### libmtev

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 1.6.8

* Add statistics for lua VM time and lua GC time.
* Expose the watchdog timeout as timeval: mtev_watchdog_get_timeout_timeval
* Expose eventer thread watchdog timeouts: eventer_watchdog_timeout_timeval
* Adjust max eventer sleeptime to not exceed 1/20 watchdog timeout.
* Heartbeat the eventer immediately upon event wakeup.
* Fix UI issue displaying histogram stats (bin compaction).
* Revert eventer_t allocation to the default allocator. This allows better
  introspection of memory usage when using jemalloc.
* Add max backlog stat for jobq and display. Job queues have had a backlog
  limit since version 1.1.3 but the value had not been exposed in the stats
  interface.
* Add filter for stats in UI. This allows for substring or regex filtering of
  the stats list, making it easier to find stats of interest.
* Be more careful when setting jobq concurrency from the console (crash fix).
* Explicitly name log dedup, amqp, and fq threads. This exposes more meaningful
  stats.
* Add more NULL safety in amqp connection management (crash fix).
* Default the jobq web UI view to hide completely unused jobqs. A slider icon
  in the top right corner of the panel can be used to toggle display of all
  jobqs.

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1555689963 (15de914)

* API: When creating a graph via the API, the 'interpolated' line_style wasn't
  being respected and was rendering as 'stepped'.
* UI: Improved graph x-axis label rendering so labels don't overlap at small
  graph sizes.
* UI: Improved multi-stream CAQL graph datapoints so each stream will be broken
  out into its own datapoint.
* UI: Added stream label support to CAQL graph datapoints, so each stream's
  datapoint will be labeled with any CAQL-specified label, when available.
* UI: Fixed graph overlay bug: when using a graph comparison overlay, changing
  the date range would cause the overlay to render improperly.
* UI: Fixed the check tree browsing panel (used in the "New Ruleset" and Graph
  "Add Datapoint" modals), so it retrieves lists of checks correctly.

## 2019-04-08

### data_storage

Version: 0.1.1554238485 (ba640ea)

* Limit search results to 10,000 items by default. This can be overridden by
  setting a request header, `x-snowth-advisory-limit`, to a positive integer
  value. Setting it to -1 or "none" removes the limit.
* Change default journal replication concurrency from 1 to 4.
* Memory leak and crash fixes.
* Alter search to include check_tags if present.
* Add flag to allow nodes to rebalance in parallel rather than forcing nodes to
  rebalance one at a time.
* Various performance improvements.
* Improved the CAQL label function to support name and tag extraction
* Faster surrogate writes (adding new metrics and updating activity
  information)
* Improve NNTBS timeshard open/close performance by reducing unnecessary
  locking
* Support added for cumulative histograms at read time
* Make rebalance more robust
* Fix crash under repetitive license violations

### GoAPI

Related roles: api, web_frontend

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1554476014 (7ca33de) (EL7, OmniOS)

No changes on EL6.

* Remove support for the `statsd_target` attribute in the `data_storage` role.
  Snowth no longer supports emitting statsd metrics. Operators currently using
  this feature are encouraged to switch to a JSON pull check against
  `/stats.json` on each snowth host.

### Reconnoiter

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 0.1.1553184123 (517592c)

* Enabled Dynamic Alerting metric_pattern rulesets with regular expression
  matching over one or all checks.
* Addressed bug in new Apache check setup that caused only half of the
  available metrics to be selectable.
* Removed all code for deprecated RuleSet History feature. This had been
  removed from UI a long time ago.

* (UI) Allow the timeline to be shown above shared graphs, including alerts and
  text metrics from the current graph, if desired.
* (UI) Updated the Metrics Explorer and Metric Detail pages so when a metric
  has multiple types (numeric, text, histogram) due to a type change, the user
  can switch between all available types for historic data visibility.
* (UI) Added a heads-up legend on the graph when in datapoint select mode
  (enter this mode by holding down the 's' key and hovering over the graph).
* (API) Add support for new metric API query parameters, `active_start`,

### libmtev

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 1.6.3

* When spawning a child asynch job within an existing asynch job, persist the
  subqueue assignment rather than always making it the first subqueue every
  time. This will help in job scheduling fairness.
* Expose `EVENTER_ASYNCH_COMPLETE` as a preferred and more descriptive literal
  for the old `EVENTER_ASYNCH` literal. `EVENTER_ASYNCH` is informally
  deprecated.
* Add aco support for non-simple asynch work (with all three asynch call
  phases).
* Add aco support for enqueueing asynch work with deadlines.
* Add support for eliding asynch work on jobs when a deadline is set and no
  cancellation type is provided (don't start work when it is already past the
  deadline).
* Fix fair scheduling of subqueues when there is a single job in flight.

  metrics having both numeric and text data (due to having their type switched
  at some point in the past.) For these metrics, the numeric type dropdown will
