### data_storage

Related roles: caql_broker, fault_detection, stratcon

Version: 0.1.1605212210 (ad1d295)

**Function Removal Notice**

> Metric Search v2 and Metric Clusters have been deprecated for some time.  We
> plan to remove these deprecated functions soon for the SaaS site, and in the
> subsequent Inside release. This will affect CAQL checks as well as CAQL
> Datapoints on graphs. The UI will now show users a warning when one of the
> deprecated functions is used. Circonus offers a more powerful tag-search
> feature, exposed as `find()` in CAQL.

* (stratcon) Fix raw_ingestor bug that could result in incorrect error
  messages.
* Improve raw_only_delete efficiency and memory usage, add `/raw_only_delete`
  REST API.
* Ensure tag-search indexes are correctly updated when deleting metrics.

### fault_detection

Version: 0.1.1604429515 (5d19ba9)

* If a ruleset would trigger due to a rule number change but the severity would
  remain at RULE_SEV_NONE, do not send a notification. This eliminates work for
  the notification system when there is no effective change of severity.

  upcoming feature that is not yet available via the UI/API.

Version (ernie): 0.1.1593201733 (d1e0e7b)

**Composite Checks Removal Notice**

Since the [2019-05-06
release](/circonus/on-premises/changelog/2019#2019-05-06), the `circonus-ernie`
service has remained, serving its secondary role as a broker for [Composite
checks](/circonus/checks/check-types/composite/). This functionality has been
replaced and extended by [CAQL
checks](/circonus/checks/check-types/caql-check/). The Composite check type,
and the supporting service, will be removed in a future release. Operators and
users of composite checks should immediately begin converting to CAQL checks.
Please contact Circonus Support (support@circonus.com) with any questions.

* No changes since [2020-06-29](/circonus/on-premises/changelog/2020#2020-06-29)

### FQ

Related roles: caql_broker, fault_detection, mq, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 0.13.1

* Add Backtrace (crash reporting) support for the FQ daemon.

### GoAPI

Related roles: api

Version: 0.8.10

* Fixes a blocking issue with fq tracing span data recording that could cause a
  goroutine leak and cause the goapi process to hang.
* Fixes a mutex lock issue in goapi fq logging that could cause the goapi
  process to hang.
* Corrects an issue that could cause duplicate token applications to attempt to
  add, resulting in a false authentication error.
* Updates OAuth2 get user information API calls to allow multiple types to be
  possible for the OAuth2 response error property.
* Returns an empty object for `/user` endpoint `contact_info` responses when no
  information exists, rather than omitting the property.
* Corrects the error code returned for unauthorized `/user` requests.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1601401182 (971bc71)

* Enable FQ crash reporting in the `mq` role.
* Add an attribute to the `stratcon` role to configure its concurrency for
  sending data into IRONdb. The `irondb_put_concurrency` value is the desired
  number of threads that should be devoted to sending metrics into IRONdb. If
  not specified, it defaults to `50`. The actual number of active threads may
  drop lower than this value, depending on the volume of metrics coming from
  brokers, but it will not exceed the configured concurrency. Raising the
  concurrency can help if the storage feeds from brokers show delay, and the
  stratcon host still has CPU and network resources to spare.

### libmtev

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 1.12.12

* Allow `<config>` in `<eventer>` to be a deep descendent.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1600699570 (f7f35e5)

* Make `data_storage` rollup suppression filter configurable. This is a tag
  query whose matching metrics will be skipped during rollup, and removed from
  the raw database as shards expire. It was hard-coded at introduction in the
  [2020-04-06 release](/circonus/on-premises/changelog/2020#2020-04-06), but it
  is an unnecessary operation if not needed.  Operators wishing to preserve the
  previous value should set the `rollup_suppression_filter` attribute to
  `and(__rollup:false)` in `site.json`. See [data_storage
  attributes](/circonus/on-premises/installation/installation/#data_storage-attributes)
  in the Installation manual for details.

  path.

### notification

Version: 0.1.1598890278 (ba1c5c5)

### GoAPI

Related roles: api

Version: 0.8.3

* Three new fields have been added to the data returned by the `/metric`
  endpoint: `_check_broker`, `_check_module`, and `_check_target`.
* Fix for worksheet graphs to be returned with incomplete CID values.
* Fix an error that would cause all worksheets returned by the API to be tagged
  as favorite.
* Fix an error that could cause the process to hang on API servers without a
  local fq installation.
* Split the goapi log into separate access and error logs. These logs by
  default will be located at `/var/log/circonus/goapi_access.log` and
  `/var/log/circonus/goapi_error.log`.
* Truncate log entry data fields at 2 KB. This prevents very long individual
  log entry data fields from obscuring the log files.
* Fix a noisy error about trace information from the proxy server.
* Change the log level of redundant errors to debug. This allows only one error
  level log entry to be reported for any single error, while extra detail will
  still be available at the debug level if needed.
* Failures to authenticate are no longer logged at the error level. They are
  instead logged at the warning level.
* Correct an issue with LDAP authentication causing cookies not to be parsed
  correctly, resulting in failed authentications.
* Correct a config load issue that would cause errors during OAuth
  authentication attempts.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1596827857 (9228394)

* Stratcon: The `uuid` attribute is deprecated in favor of a `node_ids` object
  containing a key for each stratcon host, whose value is a UUID string. All
  stratcon hosts must be included.  Previously, if multiple stratcon hosts were
  present, they would all have the same UUID. This does not cause issues for
  stratcon functionality, but does affect the metric names of its internal
  statistics. If `node_ids` is not present and there are multiple stratcon
  nodes, a warning will be issued at the end of the run.
  * Example:
    ```
    "stratcon": {
        "_machlist": [ "host1", "host2" ],
        "node_ids": {
            "host1": "<a_uuid>",

* Default timeout for `latency_sensitive` event loop increased to 10 seconds.
* Move parsing of raw data into separate jobq to process asynchronously.
* Update CAQL `search:metric:...()` to up-convert to a tag search and leverage
  the `find:...()` processing unit.
* Alter both `search:metric:...()` and `find:...()` to support external
  (out-of-band) expansion replacement. Within IRONdb, default both to internal
  index-based expansion. When not in IRONdb (CAQL-broker) maintain the
  pre-existing default (search: external, find: internal). Allow config-based

* Add support for authentication using LDAP cookies.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1595336617 (126e230)

* API: Fix regex match of origin URL in Apache configuration to allow for
  deployments where the URL host is the base site domain.
* Add optional top-level `site.json` attribute, `cookie_domain`. This is the
  domain name common to all client-facing endpoints, which will be used for
  session cookies. If absent, the `domain` value is used, and it is assumed
  that all endpoints are either the same as, or subdomains of, the site domain.
  This option may be useful if your web frontend and API hostnames are not both
  derived from the site domain. For example, if your web and API hosts are
  "circonus.example.com" and "circonusapi.example.com", respectively, then you
  would set `cookie_domain` to `example.com`.
* Add optional `site.json` attribute for the API role, `external_host`. This
  may be used in deployments where the client-facing API host does not follow
  the convention of `api.<site_domain>`. It is used by the web UI to construct
  requests from client browsers directly to the API for features such as metric
  name autocomplete in Metrics Explorer.
* Add hub cron job to gather product usage statistics on a monthly basis.

### libmtev

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

  threads could enter the S critical section.
* Support `-DMTEV_MEMORY_DEBUG` to track alloc/free stacks for
  `mtev_memory_safe` operations.
* Introduce new version global symbols to assist debuggers.
* Add `mtev_log_backtrace` that will print a previously captured backtrace.
* `MTEV_RDTSC_ENABLE` now replaces `MTEV_RDTSC_DISABLE` (defaults to off.)
* Add flexible conf interpolation system supporting `{{</*impl>:<fallback>:{<term*/>}}}`.
* Add a conf interpolation implementation for hwloc supporting numanodes, packages, cores, and pus.
* Add a conf interpolation implementation for ENV.

* Fix bug causing crashes when resuming a reconstitute and the
  `debug/surr_load` debug log is enabled.
* Remove the concept of source/category and check_name. These were metadata
  recorded in the surrogate database, and used only for Graphite searching.
  Their removal reduces complexity and saves memory, while Graphite search
  compatility is preserved through other means. **This change modifies the

  endpoint. The `_display_name` field contains the display name of the check
  which collects the metric described in the results.
* Internal logger will now submit log entry data to fq if configured.
* The check ID data cache will now only automatically update data for active
  checks, improviding query efficiency.

  `MTEV_USE_MLKV_2` is defined. This will become the default in the next major
  release and users can get their code ready now by adding `-DMTEV_USE_MLKV_2`
  to their `CPPFLAGS`. This is not ABI breaking, but the next major release
  will break the ABI such that C++ can be supported.
* Fix string-matching in `mtev_logic`.
* Add functional probability for `mtev_frrh` via `mtev_frrh_set_prob_function`.
* Remove `noitedit/strlcpy.h` header and provide that via `mtev_str.h`.
* Add `mtev_strlcpy` and `mtev_strlcat`.
* Runtime detection of ASAN to avoid `stack-buffer-underflow` failures when
  apps use ACO (runtime avoids memcpy for stack replacement).
* Allow basic use of logging immediately at application start (before init).
* Add `mtev_log_hexdump_ex`.
* Add documentation for the logging facilities.

### caql_broker

Version: 0.1.1591810140 (84eef8c)

* Load libmtev ptrace modules for better-annotated crash reporting.
* Change the `/find//active_count` API to use the `count_only` methodology from
  `find` which is faster and more memory efficient, but yields estimates when
  nodes are down.
* Support `__type:(numeric|histogram|text)` in tag searching. Does not support
  pattern matching.
* Add optional `lmdb_flags` attribute to `nntbs` and `metadata` nodes in config
  to allow for better control. Change to drop `MDB_NOMEMINIT` by default as the
  performance implications aren't significant. Drop `MDB_NOSYNC` from the
  default metadata flags.
* Allow nntbs timeshards to recover when bad data is encountered and add
  `.db.nntbs.errors (errors|ST[db-type:nntbs,...])` statistic.

### GoAPI

Related roles: api, web_frontend

Version: 0.7.4

* Improvements to memory utilization for resources shared between API and proxy
  servers.
* Fix: Improve validation error messages, on multiple endpoints, that were
  confusing because they were being wrapped inside JSON decoding error
  messages.
* Improvements to the clarity of error messages returned by the `/data`
  endpoint when required query parameters are missing or out of range.
* Include a tag containing authentication information in the GoAPI
  documentation.
* Fix: Metric search pagination no longer returns an incorrect total count.
* When annotations are created or modified, a check will be performed to verify
  that any provided related metrics actually exist.
* Validation has been improved for start and stop time fields for requests
  placed to the `/annotation` endpoint.
* Fix: Correct a problem where a successful annotation DELETE request would
  return a 404 error code, even though the delete was successful.
* Fix: If an account timezone is set to a non-null but empty string, the API
  will now correctly return a validation error.

### Hooper

Version: 0.7.2

* add: A new metric search endpoint has been added to accept metric seaches via
  POST requests. All search parameters in the query string of a GET metric
  search request can be included in a JSON object in the body of the POST
  request.
* fix: Cleans up the error message returned when POST or PUT requests to the
  `/acknowledgement` endpoint contain JSON errors, or data that does not
  validate.
* fix: Improves validation of account country code values and fixes an issue
  causing a status code 500 error to be returned if an invalid country code is
  set using the `/account` endpoint.
* fix: Metric search requests which find no results no longer return a 404
  error and instead return an empty result set `[]`.
* fix: Unauthorized PUT requests to the `/account` endpoint no longer return
  the wrong HTTP status code.
* fix: Additional validation takes place on contact group adds/updates for
  pagerduty, opsgenie, victorops, and slack contact groups. These tests prevent
  certain errors from occurring in Bert or other messaging services.
* fix: Empty results are no longer be returned by `/data/fetch` requests when
  the request is for the highcharts data format and includes a reduce
  operation.
* fix: Empty tags values will no longer be returned as null in some objects.
  All objects will now consistently return an empty array `[]` when there is no
  data for the tags field.
* fix: Search query parameters for all endpoints will no longer return an error
  if a numeric query parameter is provided but is an empty value.

### Hooper

Version: 0.1.1586206581 (fe1b966) (EL7, OmniOS)

Version: 0.1.1585315278 (c63b6a8) (EL6)

* (EL7/OmniOS only) `snowth.conf` changes:
  * Add a rollup-suppression tag search filter to the raw database. Any metrics
    having a stream tag of `__rollup:false` will not be rolled up, and will
    disappear from the raw database as time shards are deleted.
  * Turn on `accept_thread` and `fanout` for the 8112 listener. The former
    dedicates a thread to handling new connections, and the latter fans out
    events from accepted connections across threads in the default eventer
    pool. These improve performance.
  * Add a log of RocksDB activity, level "warn" and higher. This will capture
    statistics on compaction, among others. It rotates on file size and will
    not occupy more than 100 MB of total disk space.
  * Explicitly note the surrogate database attribues `cache_init_size` and
    `activity_tracking`, using the in-code default values.
* Remove extraneous blank lines from the `stratcon.conf` template. When the
  application updates its config, these lines are not present, so avoid
  putting them back when Hooper runs.

* CAQL: Remove 1y limitation on maximum request span. This limit was added to
  prevent heavy CAQL queries from overloading the system. There are now
  limits on the total number of samples fetched, and timeouts on key
  operations.

Version: 0.6.12

* fix: Issue causing some cache misses not to be recorded correctly.
* fix: Error causing contact group and metric cluster delete requests to always
  return not found errors has been fixed.
* fix: All endpoints that accept JSON data in the request body will now return
  more descriptive errors with the correct HTTP code if the JSON is invalid.
* fix: Improved validation when saving contact group data via the API. The API
  will now check and return errors if contact group type and contact methods
  are mismatched.
* fix: Parsing error that occured during metric by ID lookup with metric name
  containing certain special characters has been corrected.
* fix: Results from the `/acknowledgement` endpoint will always include the
  `notes` and other fields even when they contain no data. Now, they will be
  included with a value of `null`.
* fix: Results from the `/alert` endpoint will always contain the `_cleared_on`
  and `_acknowledgement` fields. Even if they are empty, they will now still be
  included in the results with a value of `null`.
* upd: Changes the auth service process used for token based authentication to
  not use caching by default. Auth token caching can be re-activated with an
  environment variable setting.
* fix: multiple instances where 500 errors were being returned have been fixed
  to return the correct 4XX errors and messaging.
* fix: when using token auth, if either the token or app name header is
  missing, the error code returned will be 401, previously it was incorrectly
  returning code 403 if only one of the headers was missing.
* fix: all endpoints that were returning 404 errors when performing a search
  operation that finds no results will now return `[]` instead of the error.
* fix: bug causing some tag searches for acknowledgement values to fail with a
  non-descriptive 500 error.
* fix: issue resulting in pending auth token application statuses being cached
  and not being correctly updated when the associated application is approved.
* fix: issue causing account/current not to report errors correctly when
  retrieving some types of account data.
* add: new `share_id` parameter supported by the `/data/fetch` and `/caql`
  endpoints. This allows these API endpoints to be used to fetch data for
  shared dashboards, graphs, and worksheets.
* add: new "victorops" contact method supported in the "contact_info" values
  returned by calls to the /user API endpoint. It contains the same VictorOps
  ID that is shown in the User Profile of the UI.

### Reconnoiter

Related roles: broker, caql_broker, data_storage, fault_detection, stratcon, web_stream

Version: 0.1.1584631919 (2fad75d)

* (Broker) Decouple XML culling from check deactivation. This should solve
  issues where removing large numbers of checks performs too much work with the
  master poller lock held.
* Adopt new `mtev_conf_*` section APIs.
* (Broker) Support tagged stats in the broker(selfcheck) module.
* (Broker) Make thread pool selection hierarchical and unify logic. We already
  had check-based thread selection; this expands that to allow for check-based,
  module-based, and module-name-based logic. The `ping_icmp`, `graphite`, and
  `prometheus` checks are updated to use this shared logic.
* Fix crash in socket listener when encoutering an incomplete buffer.
* (Stratcon) Add statistics related to broker jlog feed processing.
* (Broker) Add locking for safety in mtev_hash manipulation by socket
  listeners.
* (Broker) Fix crashes and multi-thread listener. The listener and handler
  shared the same describe function which was incorrect as their closure types
  are different. The opentsdb and graphite modules both registered
  (conflicting) names for the same callback -- wrap them so this isn't an
  issue. Lookup a pool by module name and balance new connections across the
  threads in that pool.

### Web UI/API

Version: 0.1.1584651786 (5992246)

* New Feature: Adds the `/docs` endpoint to GoAPI forwarding to allow public
  access to the GoAPI documentation. Accessible at `https://<api_url_host>/docs`,
  e.g., `https://api.circonus.com/docs`.
* Bugfix: fix bug preventing the addition of metrics to graphs with the default
  numeric type.

  follow your OS or browser preference, but you may set it explicitly under
  User Preferences.

**Function Removal Notice**

> Metric Search v2 and Metric Clusters have been deprecated for some time.  We
> plan to remove these deprecated functions soon for the SaaS site, and in the
> subsequent Inside release. This will affect CAQL checks as well as CAQL
> Datapoints on graphs. The UI will now show users a warning when one of the
> deprecated functions is used. Circonus offers a more powerful tag-search
> feature, exposed as `find()` in CAQL.
