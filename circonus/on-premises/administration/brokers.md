# Brokers

New brokers can be added via the "/admin/broker" section of the admin interface.  The name of the broker can help identify the machine it runs on and where it is located.  The IP is required to be open to the stratcons so they can pull down data. The admin ties this broker to whichever account is to be the "owner" of the broker.

The owning account is the only account allowed to make edits to the broker in the UI and attach a contact group to it to be notified if it disconnects.  Further accounts can then be tied to the broker as "shared accounts", which gives them the ability to provision checks on the broker.
