# Accounts

Accounts can be managed via the "/admin/account" section of the admin interface.  You may create as many accounts as you like, and you can limit them to any number of hosts you wish.

It is recommended that you create an account for each group that wishes to use the system. This helps further organize data and can help scale the system should one group start using Circonus more heavily than another.
