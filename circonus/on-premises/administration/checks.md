# Checks

The "Checks" portion of the admin interface is a read-only tool designed to help with further troubleshooting.

The interface allows you to search by check ID (as seen in the web UI URLs) or by name.  Viewing the details of a check then provides you with a UUID of the check, which is used internally in many of the systems (brokers, fault detection, etc.). Viewing the check details also provides some broker details and metric information.

The metrics listed are all of the currently active metrics, along with their event IDs as used by the fault detection and notification systems, and also along with the number of rules associated with each metric.
